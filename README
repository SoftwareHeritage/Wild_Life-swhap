The user manual was written by Hassan Ait-Kaci, Richard Meyer, and Peter
Van Roy.

The Wild_LIFE interpreter is the first implementation of the LIFE
language available to the general public.  It is a product of the
Paradise project at DEC PRL.  Research activities of Paradise deal
with issues pertaining to general purpose programming by specifying
executable constraints, including theoretical foundations, implementation,
and development of applications.

Wild_LIFE has been extensively tested on DECstations running Ultrix.  We
are committed to support this system and we are working on substantial
improvements.  We would appreciate for you to send your name and address
to life-request@prl.dec.com.  That will make it easier for us to notify
you of upgrades.  We solicit feedback on any aspect of the system: bug
reports, functionality, extensions, user manual, user interface, examples,
etc.  If you extend the system, we would like to know exactly what you did
and why.

*** WARNING: The X interface has been tested only on DECstations.

*** WARNING: To be able to run all the example programs on a DECstation,
    it is mandatory that you install *all* the MIT X fonts.  Consult your
    local X guru!

*** URGENT REQUEST: We do not have an adequate environment to test this
    system on multiple platforms (e.g., SPARCstations).  We would greatly
    appreciate if someone would try installing it on other platforms and
    tell us what modifications were necessary.  In particular, we would
    appreciate someone getting the X interface to work on SPARCstations.

The LIFE language

LIFE (Logic, Inheritance, Functions, and Equations) is an experimental
programming language with a powerful facility for structured type
inheritance. It reconciles styles from functional programming, logic
programming, and object-oriented programming. It subsumes, and fully
contains the functionality of, the precursor languages LOGIN and Le_Fun.
The syntax of Wild_LIFE has been kept as close as possible to that of the
Edinburgh family of Prolog so that Prolog compatibility is easy to
achieve.

From a theoretical point of view, LIFE implements a constraint logic
programming language with equality (unification) and entailment (matching)
constraints over order-sorted feature terms. The interplay of unification
and matching provides an implicit coroutining facility thanks to an
automatic suspension mechanism.  This allows interleaving interpretation
of relational and functional expressions which specify structural
dependencies on objects.

The basic data structure is the order-sorted feature term, or psi-term.
Psi-terms are a natural generalisation of first-order terms. A psi-term may
be viewed as being to a Prolog term what an open-ended dynamic record is to
a static array.  That is, a psi-term has named fields and fields may be
added at run-time.  Psi-terms may be cyclic, which means they are rooted
graphs and that the occur-check problem of Prolog goes away.

A program in LIFE consists of a declaration of the a sort hierarchy
constraining psi-terms, along with functions and predicates defining
operations on psi-terms.  Functions are called with matching (i.e., an
implication constraint) and they suspend if the truth of the implication
cannot be determined.  Predicates are called with unification (i.e., an
equality constraint) and they force the equality to be true.  They may try
more than one possible value with backtracking.  In other words, a
function waits for its actual arguments to carry as much information as
imposed by its formal arguments, whereas a predicate takes the initiative
of synthesizing missing information using its definition's argument
patterns.  These two modes of computation are complementary and allow an
elegant programming style.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Installation:

1. Uncompress and untar the file Life.tar.Z.  This creates the Life/
   directory.
2. Change directory to the Life/ directory (which contains this README file).
3. Run 'make' to create the executable 'wild_life'.  The complete system
   including the .o files and the executable needs about 5.4 MB of disk
   space.
   The Tests/ subdirectory may be removed to save space (see below).
4. The wild_life.1 file is a man page for the system.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Remarks:

1. On startup, the interpreter loads an optional .wild_life customization
   file.  It looks for this file first in the current directory and then
   in your home directory.  If none is found then none is loaded.
2. The interpreter may be run from anywhere and copied to anywhere and
   executed there.  However, the Life/ directory must remain in the same
   place, since the interpreter uses several files in it during startup.
3. The subdirectory Tests/ contains a series of test programs.  They may
   be run by cd'ing to Tests/ and running the script Test_all (without
   arguments).  The script creates a file ERROR.diff that shows the
   differences between the obtained results and the correct results.  After 
   running it, you may see some small differences due to the Life/
   directory being in a different path.  These small differences may be
   ignored.  The Tests/ directory is rather large (about 1.6 MB).  It may
   be removed to save space.
4. By default, the system has a memory space of 4 MB.  This can be changed
   by redefining the MEM_SIZE parameter in the file extern.h.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Documentation and example programs:

The subdirectory Documents/ contains the most recent draft of the user manual
in both PostScript and dvi formats.

The subdirectory Examples/ contains some example programs.  These can be
loaded from anywhere with the 'load' command without an explicit path, since
'load' does a search.  See the file Examples/README for more information.

The Paradise project has written many articles and research reports on
various aspects of LIFE.  What follows is a list along with the subject
line of the message to send to doc-server@prl.dec.com to get a copy.
The online version is sent back to you as a set of PostScript files that
may each be printed independently.  For example, to get a PostScript copy
of report number 12, send mail to doc-server@prl.dec.com with subject
"send report 12".  To get the printed version you must put your name and
address in the message body.

Bug reporting:

If you find what you think is a new bug, please, first read the manual
carefully to see if it really is a bug.  If it is, try to find the
*smallest* program that illustrates the bug and mail it to
life-bugs@prl.dec.com together with a script that shows the bug.  An
especially sensitive way to find bugs is to do your work in 'verbose'
mode, which tells you what is happening to the system stacks.

We are working hard to correct all bugs, small as well as large.  Future
releases will be more robust and have more functionality.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The most important known bugs:

1. Recursive sort declarations need special care: they should be accompanied
   by a 'delay_check' call and they must be used in a particular way,
   otherwise the interpreter goes into an infinite loop when trying to
   satisfy the sort's constraints.  'delay_check' is propagated correctly to
   the sort's children.

2. The system incorrectly handles deep guards, that is, evaluable things
   (which includes functions, predicates, and disjunctions) inside the heads
   of function definitions (but evaluable things inside the heads of predicate
   definitions are handled correctly).  This has to do with the global/local
   variable distinction: function calls do not change their arguments.

3. The system is not complete for disentailment of equality constraints
   introduced in the actual arguments of a function call.  However, it
   *is* complete for disentailment of equality constraints in the function
   definition.  If you don't understand this, then this problem will most
   likely not affect you.

Relevant electronic mail addresses:

   Here are email addresses that are relevant to LIFE and Paradise:

   life-users@prl.dec.com

      This is a mailing list of people using LIFE or interested in
      specific aspects of LIFE, whether theory, implementation, or
      applications. It is meant as a public forum to answer FAQ's and
      share programs and ideas. It is not meant to report bugs, although
      it may be used to ask public opinions about surprising behavior of
      Wild_LIFE that may turn out to be a bug and to warn others against
      confirmed bugs.

   life-request@prl.dec.com

      This address is to be used to request to be put on, or removed
      from, the life-users mailing list.

   life-bugs@prl.dec.com

      When you strongly suspect a bug (i.e., after reading the manual,
      the life-users' FAQ's, and polling life-users's opinion about the
      symptoms), try to find the *smallest* program that illustrates the
      bug and mail it to this address together with a script that shows
      the bug.

   paradise@prl.dec.com

      This is PRL's local LIFE community. That is, all the PRL people
      involved in some activity in the Paradise project at PRL. Use this
      for general communication of matters of interest to this group
      alone.
