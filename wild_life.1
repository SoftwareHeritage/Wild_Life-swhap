NAME
    wild_life - interpreter for the LIFE language

DESCRIPTION
    LIFE (Logic, Inheritance, Functions, Equations) is an experimental
    programming language with a powerful facility for structured type
    inheritance.  LIFE reconciles styles from Functional Programming and
    Logic Programming by implicitly delegating control to an automatic
    suspension mechanism.  This allows interleaving interpretation of
    relational and functional expressions which specify structural
    dependencies on objects.

    The Wild_Life interpreter is a fully functional implementation of the
    LIFE language.  It has a comfortable user interface with incremental
    query extension ability.  It contains an extensive set of built-in
    operations as well as an X Windows interface.

OPTIONS

    -q   Quiet mode.  Forces completely silent operation, i.e., no user
	 interface information (prompts, variable values, Yes/No messages,
         startup banner, exit banner) will be printed.  This allows Wild_Life
         to be used as an element of a Unix pipe with minimal hassle.  Errors,
         warnings, trace messages, program output (with the write statement
         etc.), and file I/O are still output.  As before, errors and warnings
         are output to stderr, trace information to stdout.  In 'verbose' mode
         the quiet mode is disabled, which allows the user to inspect a
	 misbehaving Wild_Life when it is being used as a pipe element.

FILES
    Life/Documents (documentation)
    Life/Examples (example programs)

EXAMPLES
    The directory Life/Examples contains a set of example programs.
    These programs can be loaded directly into the interpreter with
    the 'load' command.

    The following example shows how to run a program that solves the
    SEND+MORE=MONEY puzzle:
