                        A LITTLE PERT SCHEDULER


 NAME

 schedule: A demo using constraints on sorts and residuation to achieve
           performance and conciseness.


 USAGE (see examples)
 In a query, declare the activities you consider and the information you have
 about them:
       A1 = activity( duration => 34, prerequisites => [A2,A3]), ...
            %%% A2 and A3 must be defined in the same query, and are references
            %%% to activities that must be performed before A1 

 when all activities are declared, they may be visualized with
       visAllActs(List_of_Acts)?


 FILES
 The file schedule.lf contains the scheduler. .in files contain examples.


 DESCRIPTION
 
 All constraints are set during the type check, and they are released as soon
 as if enough information is known.
 Each time an activity is defined, the earlyStart field is initialized with the
 earlyCalc function. This function takes the list of prerequisites as argument,
 and residuates on the activities which are still undefined.
 
 Defining the activity also sets a set of constraints on the lateStart field of
 the prerequisites. Here again, these constraints residuate until enough
 information is known.

 This way, every necessary computation is done once and only once.
